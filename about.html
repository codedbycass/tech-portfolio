            <h1>Learn more about me</h1>
            <p>As a child of Lao refugees, I didn’t have a blueprint written out for me about how to navigate success in
                the US. At first, the ambiguity and lack of direction scared me, but I took it as an invitation to
                nurture my curiosities and freedoms.</p>
            <p>As a software engineer, I aim to combine my technical knowledge and diverse experiences–– customer service working with people
                and databases; academic training in the sciences and humanities honing my critical thinking and
                diligence; project management experience developing and leading a culturally relevant digital equity
                program for immigrants and refugees–– to make technologies that serve, not only the average user, but
                those who are socially and economically marginalized from meaningfully participating in both the digital
                and material world. </p>
